# FashionAI – Generative AI for Brand-Aligned Campaign Ideation

FashionAI is a proof-of-concept tool created to demonstrate how generative AI can support early-stage marketing ideation for fashion and retail brands. The project was built independently to showcase alignment with Gen Z audiences.

## 🔍 Project Overview

FashionAI uses large language models and image generation to prototype campaign visuals and copy. It’s designed to support creative teams by:

* Generating fashion visuals aligned with seasonal trends and target aesthetics
* Producing brand-consistent campaign copy
* Providing an ideation starting point for marketing and design teams

## 🧠 Why It Matters

FashionAI isn’t a finished product — it’s a demonstration of how data science and creative tooling can intersect. Most data scientists don’t work in this space. This project bridges the gap between generative AI capabilities and retail marketing workflows.

## 💡 Key Features

* Prompt-driven generative imagery (Gen Z aesthetic focus)
* Copy generation tuned for voice and seasonal relevance
* Discussion of ethical use (diverse, inclusive image prompting)
* Business framing aligned with campaign development needs

## 🛠️ Tools Used

* Python (notebook-based exploration)
* OpenAI GPT + Diffusion-based image generation
* Markdown and HTML for presentation layer
