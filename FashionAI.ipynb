A structured builder reduces variability and increases the likelihood of usable outputs.\n","* **Scalability**: In a future tool, this type of prompt automation enables non-technical users (e.g., marketers) to generate assets safely without needing deep prompt engineering knowledge.\n","\n","By templating prompts, we make AI generation safer, faster, and more effective for real-world creative teams.\n","\n","**Note:** This is a rudimentary prompt control mechanism used only for proof-of-concept purposes.
